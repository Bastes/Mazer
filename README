=Maze

A fun little gem to generate and explore mazes.

It's easy to make a maze :

- Maze::Maze.new(5) will build a 5x5 maze.
- Maze::Maze.new(8,6) will build a 8x6 maze.

You can access cells :
- maze = Maze(10)
- cell = maze[2, 5] # read cell at [2, 5]
- cell.north # read cell at [2, 4]
- cell.door :west # west door closed => nil
- cell.open :east # open the door to [3, 5] => cell at [3, 5]
- cell.door_east # east door open => cell at [3, 5]

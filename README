= Maze

A fun little gem to generate and explore mazes.

== Mazes

see Mazer::Maze

It's easy to make a maze :
 Maze::Maze.new(5)   # will build a 5x5 maze.
 Maze::Maze.new(8,6) # will build a 8x6 maze.
 
== Cells

see Mazer::Cell

You can access cells :
 maze = Maze(10)   # generates the maze
 cell = maze[2, 5] # read cell at [2, 5]
 cell.north        # read cell at [2, 4]
 cell.door :west   # west door closed => nil
 cell.open :east   # open the door to [3, 5] => cell at [3, 5]
 cell.door_east    # east door open => cell at [3, 5]
